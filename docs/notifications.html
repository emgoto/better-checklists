        <h1>Notification Settings</h1>
        <p>When notifications are enabled for tasks, Checklist+ can post a
            comment on the card, and @mention the member assigned to the task. This will send out a
            notification to that user, looking something like this:
        </p>

        <p>Insert example iamge here!</p>

        <h2>Users with commenting permissions enabled</h2>
        <div id="commenting-enabled">
            <div id="enable-instructions">To enable this feature, at least one user needs to have enabled comments to be
                posted using their account.
            </div>
        </div>
        <button id="authenticate-btn" hidden>Authenticate</button>
        <button id="enable-btn">
            <div id="enable-text">Enable commenting using your account</div>
            <div id="enable-spinner"></div>
        </button>

        <div id="solo-instructions">
            <br /><br />
            <p>
                If you are the only user that has enabled commenting, @mentions by Checklist+ will always use your
                account.
                This effectively means that you will not receive any notifications for @mentioning yourself!
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend making sure at least two board members have enabled commenting, or
                creating a separate bot account for this purpose.
