        <p>When a Checklist+ task is either approaching its due date or is due, Checklist+ can automatically post a
            comment on the card on your behalf, and @ mention the member assigned to the task.
        </p>

        <h2>Users with commenting enabled</h2>
        <div id="commenting-enabled"></div>
        <button id="authenticate" hidden>Authenticate</button>
        <button id="enable">Enable commenting using your account</button>

        <p><i>Note: If a comment is posted on your behalf for a task assigned to you, you will not receive a
                notification.
                We recommend either making sure at least two board members have given commenting permissions, or
                creating a separate bot account just for this purpose.
