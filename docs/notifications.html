        <p>When a task is either approaching its due date or is due, Checklist+ can post a
            comment on the card, and @ mention the member assigned to the task. This will send out a
            notification to that user, looking something like this:
        </p>

        <p>Insert example iamge here!</p>

        <p>
            To enable this feature, at least one user needs to have authenticated and given permission for comments to
            be posted on their behalf.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Please note that if a comment is posted on your behalf for a task assigned to you, you won't receive a
                notification.
                We recommend making sure at least two board members have given commenting permissions, or
                creating a separate bot account for this purpose.
            </i>
